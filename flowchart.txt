1. Importing the Packages 
2. Data Exploration  - Skin Disease Data
3. Image Processing 
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Rescaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image
	- Using Opencv + Pillow + Torchvision
		- Reading the image
		- resizing the image
		- transforming to tensor using torchvision
4. Data Extraction into training and validation
5. Building the model 
	- Inception ResNet V2
	- Inception V3
	- MobileNet
	- MobileNet V2
	- ZeroShot Neural Network
	- GAN
6. Training the model 

Flask Framework
----------------

7. Flask Framework – Localhost – Signup & Sign In with sqlite3
8. User uploads the image for analysis
9. The Given image is processed 
	- using keras image to array 
	- Reshaping the Image 
10. Trained model is used for predicting user data
11. Predict with model for outcome
12. Displaying the final outcome

Note
-----

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different deep learning models like meta-zero shot Neural Network, Generative Adversarial 
Networks-GAN,InceptionV3, Inception resNetV2,MobileNet, MobileNetV2 
So we implement the models with dataset mentioned, from that MobileNet got 80% accuracy for analysis and building the model for the
user upload inputs.
