Skin disease is the most common disease in the world. The diagnosis of the skin disease requires a high level of expertise and accuracy for dermatologist, so computer aided skin disease diagnosis model is proposed to provide more objective and reliable solution. Many researches were done to help detect skin diseases like skin cancer and tumor skin. But the accurate recognition of the disease is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between Disease and non-Disease area, etc. 
This project aims to detect skin disease from the skin image and to analyze this image by applying filter to remove noise or unwanted things, convert the image to grey to help in the processing and get the useful information. This help to give evidence for any type of skin disease and illustrate emergency orientation. For this purpose in this paper we are using algorithms such as Inception ResNet V2, Inception V3, MobileNet , MobileNet V2 and ZeroShot Neural Network. Analysis result of this study can support doctor to help in initial diagnoses and to know the type of disease. That is compatible with skin and to avoid side effects.
